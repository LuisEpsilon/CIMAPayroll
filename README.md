# Version Storage Repository

This repository serves as a version storage for the DSCCS project (Dexterity's Version Control System), which is designed to fulfill the requirements of the CIMA client for Epsilon (Payroll). It is initially utilized for the upgrade from version 18.2 to 18.6 of Dynamics GP.

## Description

The Version Storage Repository is the result of synchronizing the folders used by the DSCCS. Unlike DSCCS, this repository does not use dictionaries to store versions, making it more accessible and versatile. It solely contains information about developments for the functionalities contained in the forms, reports, and scripts within the repository.

## Features

- **Version Storage:** Allows storing and managing versions of files used in the DSCCS project.
- **Compatibility with Dexterity:** Although Dexterity does not directly use Git, this repository can be synchronized with the project's folders to maintain a version history.
- **Possibility of Storing Additional Work Results:** In the future, additional work results such as macros for generating CNK and the different versions of CNK that change over time can be stored.
